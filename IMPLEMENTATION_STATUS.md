### ⏸️ Phase 3: Frontend Application (NOT STARTED)

### 🔗 Integrations / Connectors (NEW)

- ✅ QuickBooks connector scaffolded (OAuth start/callback, sync routes, mapping helpers)
- ✅ Database persistence implemented for connector (Knex-based repos, migrations and raw init scripts)
- ✅ Admin API + tiny static admin UI implemented for tenant mappings (list / create / delete)
- ✅ Server-to-server auth flow for service sessions added (Identity `/auth/service-token` and connector `/api/admin/session`) — admin UI uses httpOnly session cookie
- ✅ Rate-limiting, request auditing (DB + repo), and request logging added to admin endpoints
- ✅ Dev Docker Compose and a minimal compose variant created; iterative fixes applied (Dockerfile npm install changes, host port remap, ts-node/CJS adjustments)
- ✅ Connector health endpoint verified (GET /health -> { status: 'ok' })
- ✅ Commits pushed to repository (changes for connector, DB, and runtime fixes)
- ⚠️ In progress / partial: migrations — `knex migrate` attempted against the compose Postgres; some migration files report as pending while migration attempts indicate existing tables (duplicate/replayed migrations or pre-existing schema). Migration reconciliation required (see "Recent verification" below).
- ⚠️ In progress: runtime/start stability across developer environments (TS/ESM vs CJS): a working dev flow (ts-node) is in place in containers, but a single unified local start command for all developer OSes is still pending.
- ⚠️ Pending: token refresh worker, encrypted token storage, hardened production session flow for admin UI, and a polished one-command dev bootstrap that is robust across Windows host bind-mount behavior.

Recent verification
- Connector process is running and responds on /health (tested locally against the minimal compose).
- `knex migrate:latest` was run against the compose Postgres with explicit DB env — migration attempt failed reporting that core tables (e.g., `qbo_tokens`) already exist while `knex_migrations` shows migrations as pending. This indicates the schema already contains the tables (possibly from a previous manual init or partial run) but the migrations table wasn't marked. Next action: reconcile migrations by either migrating against a fresh DB, creating the `knex_migrations` entries for already-applied files, or writing idempotent migrations.

Next steps (short list)
1. Reconcile and apply connector migrations cleanly:
   - Option A: point migrations at a fresh Postgres DB and run `knex migrate:latest` to establish baseline.
   - Option B: insert rows into `knex_migrations` for already-applied migration files, then run remaining migrations.
2. Validate admin flows end-to-end: call `/api/admin/session`, then list/create/delete mappings and verify audit rows in DB.
3. Stabilize dev start for Windows developers: provide a dev-compose variant or documented workaround that preserves image node_modules or uses remote file sync (avoid host-mounted node_modules).
4. Reintroduce or adapt API Gateway (Kong) in dev compose only after images/tags are validated for the environment.



#### Frontend Framework Setup
- ⚠️ **PENDING:** React + Vite + TypeScript setup
- ⚠️ **PENDING:** Component library structure
- ⚠️ **PENDING:** Routing configuration
- ⚠️ **PENDING:** State management setup

### ⏸️ Phase 4: PayDay Pro Module (NOT STARTED)

### ⏸️ Phase 5: Integration & Testing (NOT STARTED)

### ⏸️ Phase 6: Deployment & Launch (NOT STARTED)

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js 18+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Docker Desktop** - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
3. **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)

### Getting Started

1. **Initial Setup:**
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

2. **Start Development Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Start infrastructure services
   npm run docker:up
   
   # Start development servers
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access Services:**
   - Identity Service: http://localhost:3001/health
   - Tenant Service: http://localhost:3002/health
   - API Gateway: http://localhost:8080
   - Database: postgresql://nexus:nexus_dev_password@localhost:5432/
   - Redis: redis://localhost:6379
   - RabbitMQ: http://localhost:15672 (nexus/nexus_dev_password)

### Available Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run setup          # Complete initial setup
npm run dev           # Start all services in development
npm run dev:identity  # Start identity service only
npm run dev:tenant    # Start tenant service only

# Docker
npm run docker:up     # Start all Docker services
npm run docker:down   # Stop all Docker services  
npm run docker:logs   # View Docker service logs
npm run docker:build  # Build all Docker images

# Database
npm run setup:db      # Initialize databases

# Quality & Testing
npm run build         # Build all services
npm run test          # Run all tests
npm run lint          # Lint all code
```

### One-command dev bootstrap (QuickBooks connector)

To start a minimal development environment that brings up Postgres, initializes the QuickBooks connector database, and tails logs, run:

```powershell
npm run dev:bootstrap
```

This uses `docker-compose.dev.yml` (root) and the connector init script at `services/quickbooks-connector/scripts/init_db.mjs`.

├── RabbitMQ (Message Broker)  
└── Kong (API Gateway)
```

## 📊 Current Metrics

- **Services Configured:** 3/3 (Identity, Tenant, Payroll)
- **Database Schemas:** 1/3 (Identity complete)
- **API Routes:** Basic structure (20+ endpoints defined)
- **Docker Services:** 6/6 (PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Kong, Services)
- **Development Tools:** Fully configured
- **Code Quality:** TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier configured

## 🚨 Known Issues & Dependencies

1. **Docker Desktop Required:** Services depend on Docker for local development
2. **Database Migrations:** Need to run migrations after Docker setup
3. **Service Dependencies:** Identity service must start before others
4. **Environment Files:** Each service needs .env configuration
